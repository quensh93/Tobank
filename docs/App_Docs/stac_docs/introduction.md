What is Stac?
**Stac** is a **Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework for Flutter** that allows you to build, update, and deliver dynamic user interfaces without redeploying your app. Instead of hard-coding every widget in Flutter, you define your UI as **Stac Widgets** that render at runtime from JSON. This approach separates your app’s presentation layer from its business logic, enabling teams to:
  * **Ship updates instantly.** Just update your StacWidgets and push them to Stac Cloud.
  * **Feature Experimentation** (A/B testing, personalization, etc.) without new releases.
  * **Maintain consistency** across platforms using a unified schema.
  * **Empower non-developers** (like designers or PMs) to manage layout and content.
