# Quickstart

Get your first Stac app running in under 5 minutes. This guide covers CLI setup, Stac Cloud integration, and building your first server-driven UI.

## 
​
Prerequisites
  * Flutter SDK: `>=3.35.0`
  * Dart SDK: `>=3.0.0 <4.0.0`

## 
​
Create a Flutter app (if needed)
If you don’t already have a Flutter app, create one and navigate into it:
Copy
```
flutter create stac_demo
cd stac_demo

```

## 
​
Sign up
The first thing you’ll need to do is sign up for a Stac account. It’s free and only takes a few seconds. To create an account, head over to our Console and sign in with Google: console.stac.dev.
## 
​
Install Stac CLI
The Stac CLI helps you scaffold projects, manage screens, and deploy to Stac Cloud.
  * macOS / Linux

Open your terminal and run:
Copy
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StacDev/install/main/install.sh | bash

```

Verify installation:
Copy
```
stac --version

```

## 
​
Login to Stac
Run the login command. This opens your browser to authenticate with Google.
Copy
```
stac login

```

## 
​
Initialize Stac in your project
From your Flutter app directory, initialize Stac:
Copy
```
stac init

```

You’ll be prompted to select an option. You can either choose to use an existing project or create a new one.
Copy
```
stac_demo % stac init

[INFO] Initializing Stac project in this directory: 
 /Users/StudioProjects/stac_app/stac_demo
? Please select an option: ›                                                                                                                                                             
❯ Use an existing project
  Create a new project
  Don't set up a default project  

```

We’ll select “Create a new project”. Name it `stac demo` and press enter.
Copy
```
✔ Please select an option: · Create a new project
✔ Enter project name: · stac demo
✔ Enter project description (optional): ·
[INFO] Initializing project: stac demo

```

If you are not sure about other options, you can always hit enter to choose the default option.
Stac will now initialize the project and you’ll see a message saying
Copy
```
[SUCCESS] ✓ Added dependency: stac_core
[SUCCESS] ✓ Project initialized successfully!
[INFO] Next steps:
[INFO]   1. Add your Stac widgets definitions to /stac
[INFO]   2. Run "stac build" to convert Dart to JSON
[INFO]   3. Run "stac deploy" to deploy to cloud

```

`stac init` will add the following to your project:
  * `stac/hello_world.dart` – A Hello World example widget. All your Stac widgets live in the `stac` folder.
  * Adds `stac` and `stac_core` to your `pubspec.yaml`.
  * Creates `default_stac_options.dart`, which defines your `StacOptions` (e.g., project name and ID).

## 
​
Build Stac widgets
Head over to `stac/hello_world.dart` and build the widget. Use the `@StacScreen` annotation to mark the widget as a screen.
Copy
```
import 'package:stac_core/stac_core.dart';
@StacScreen(screenName: 'hello_world')
StacWidget helloWorld() {
  return StacScaffold(
    body: StacCenter(child: StacText(data: 'Hello, world!')),
  );
}

```

Stac follows Flutter’s conventions for building widgets. For example, to use Flutter’s `Scaffold`, use the `StacScaffold` widget.
## 
​
Deploy Stac widgets
Now that we have our widget built, we can deploy it to Stac Cloud.
Copy
```
stac deploy

```

This finds all widgets in the `stac` folder, builds them, and deploys them to Stac Cloud.
Copy
```
stac_demo % stac deploy
[INFO] Building project before deployment...
[INFO] Building Stac project...
[INFO] Source directory: stac
[INFO] Output directory: stac/.build

[INFO] Deploying screens to cloud...
[INFO] Uploading: hello_world.json
[SUCCESS] ✓ Uploaded: hello_world.json
[SUCCESS] ✓ Deployment completed successfully!
[INFO] Deployed 1 file(s)

```

## 
​
Initialize Stac
Now that your project is set up, open `main.dart` and initialize Stac.
Copy
```
import 'package:stac_demo/default_stac_options.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stac/stac.dart';
void main() async {
  await Stac.initialize(options: defaultStacOptions);
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

```

Now that stac is initalize our app is ready to be dynamic and server driven. We can now render our `hello_world` screen using the `stac` widget.
Copy
```
Stac(routeName: 'hello_world'),

```

Here is the full example:
Copy
```
import 'package:example_app/default_stac_options.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stac/stac.dart';
void main() {
  Stac.initialize(options: defaultStacOptions);
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const Stac(routeName: 'hello_world'),
    );
  }
}

```

That’s it!! With just a few lines of code, your SDUI app is up and running.  When you make changes in `stac/hello_world.dart`, run `stac deploy` and your app will update instantly — no App Store or Play Store approvals needed.
## 
​
Stac Cloud
Open the Stac Cloud dashboard to see your deployed screen: console.stac.dev. 
Verification: After deploying, run your app. You should see the `hello_world` screen. In the Console, the screen appears under your project’s Screens list.
