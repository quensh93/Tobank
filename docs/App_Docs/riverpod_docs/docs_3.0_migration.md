  * Migrating from 2.0 to 3.0
# Migrating from 2.0 to 3.0
For the list of changes, please refer to the What's new in Riverpod 3.0 page.
Riverpod 3.0 introduces a number of breaking changes that may require you to update your code. They should in general be relatively minor, but we recommend you to read this page carefully.
This migration is supposed to be smooth.  
If there is anything that is unclear, or if you encountered a scenario that is difficult to migrate, please open an issue.
It is important to us that the migration is as smooth as possible, so we will do our best to help you, improve the migration guide, or even include helpers to make the migration easier.
## Automatic retry​
Riverpod 3.0 now automatically retries failing providers by default. This means that if a provider fails to compute its value, it will automatically retry until it succeeds.
In general, this is a good thing as it makes your app more resilient to transient errors. However, you may want to disable/customize this behavior in some cases.
To disable automatic retry globally, you can do so on `ProviderContainer`/`ProviderScope`:
  * ProviderScope
  * ProviderContainer
```
voidmain(){  
runApp(  
ProviderScope(  
// Never retry any provider  
      retry:(retryCount, error)=>null,  
      child:MyApp(),  
),  
);  
}  
```
```
voidmain(){  
final container =ProviderContainer(  
// Never retry any provider  
    retry:(retryCount, error)=>null,  
);  
}  
```
Alternatively, you can disable automatic retry on a per-provider basis by using the `retry` parameter of the provider:
  * riverpod
  * riverpod_generator
```
final todoListProvider =NotifierProvider>(  
TodoList.new,  
// Never retry this specific provider  
  retry:(retryCount, error)=>null,  
);  
```
```
// Never retry this specific provider  
Duration?retry(int retryCount,Object error)=>null;  
@Riverpod(retry: retry)  
classTodoListextends _$TodoList{  
@override  
Listbuild()=>[];  
}  
```
## Out of view providers are paused​
In Riverpod 3.0, out of view providers are paused by default.
There is currently no way to disable this behavior globally, but you can control the pause behavior at the consumer level by using the TickerMode widget.
```
classMyWidgetextendsStatelessWidget{  
@override  
Widgetbuild(BuildContext context){  
returnTickerMode(  
      enabled:true,// Never pause any descendant listener.  
      child:Consumer(  
        builder:(context, ref, child){  
// This "watch" will not follow the automatic pausing behavior  
// until TickerMode is removed.  
final value = ref.watch(myProvider);  
returnText(value.toString());  
},  
),  
);  
}  
}  
```
## StateProvider, StateNotifierProvider, and ChangeNotifierProvider are moved to a new import​
In Riverpod 3.0, `StateProvider`, `StateNotifierProvider`, and `ChangeNotifierProvider` are considered "legacy".  
They are not removed, but are no longer part of the main API. This is to discourage their use in favor of the new `Notifier` API.
To keep using them, you need to change your imports to one of the following:
```
import'package:hooks_riverpod/legacy.dart';  
import'package:flutter_riverpod/legacy.dart';  
import'package:riverpod/legacy.dart';  
```
## Providers now all use == to filter updates​
Before, Riverpod was inconsistent in how it filtered updates to providers. Some providers used `==` to filter updates, while others used `identical`. In Riverpod 3.0, all providers now use `==` to filter updates.
The most likely way for you to be impacted by this change is when using StreamProvider/StreamNotifier, as now stream values will be filtered by `==`. If you need to, you can override `Notifier.updateShouldNotify` to customize the behavior.
  * riverpod
  * riverpod_generator
```
classTodoListextendsStreamNotifier{  
@override  
Streambuild()=>Stream(...);  
@override  
  bool updateShouldNotify(AsyncValue previous,AsyncValue next){  
// Custom implementation  
returntrue;  
}  
}  
```
```
@riverpod  
classTodoListextends _$TodoList{  
@override  
Streambuild()=>Stream(...);  
@override  
  bool updateShouldNotify(AsyncValue previous,AsyncValue next){  
// Custom implementation  
returntrue;  
}  
}  
```
In the scenario where you didn't use a `Notifier`, you can refactor your provider in its notifier equivalent (Such as converting StreamProvider to StreamNotifierProvider).
## ProviderObserver has its interface slightly changed​
For the sake of mutations, the ProviderObserver interface has changed slightly.
Instead of two separate parameters for ProviderContainer and ProviderBase, a single `ProviderObserverContext` object is passed. This object contains both the container, provider, and extra information (such as the associated mutation).
To migrate, you need to update all methods of your observers like so:
```
class MyObserver extends ProviderObserver {  
 @override  
-  void didAddProvider(ProviderBase provider, Object? value, ProviderContainer container) {  
+  void didAddProvider(ProviderObserverContext context, Object? value) {  
   // ...  
 }  
}  
```
## Simplified Ref and removed Ref subclasses​
For the sake of simplification, Ref has lost its type parameter, and all properties/methods that were using the type parameter have been moved to Notifiers. 
Specifically, `ProviderRef.state`, `Ref.listenSelf` and `FutureProviderRef.future` should be replaced by `Notifier.state`, `Notifier.listenSelf` and `AsyncNotifier.future` respectively.
  * riverpod
  * riverpod_generator
```
// Before:  
final valueProvider =FutureProvider((ref)async{  
  ref.listen(anotherProvider,(previous, next){  
    ref.state++;  
});  
  ref.listenSelf((previous, next){  
print('Log: $previous -> $next');  
});  
  ref.future.then((value){  
print('Future: $value');  
});  
return0;  
});  
// After  
classValueextendsAsyncNotifier{  
@override  
Futurebuild()async{  
    ref.listen(anotherProvider,(previous, next){  
      ref.state++;  
});  
listenSelf((previous, next){  
print('Log: $previous -> $next');  
});  
    future.then((value){  
print('Future: $value');  
});  
return0;  
}  
}  
final valueProvider =AsyncNotifierProvider(Value.new);  
```
```
// Before:  
@riverpod  
Futurevalue(ValueRef ref)async{  
  ref.listen(anotherProvider,(previous, next){  
    ref.state++;  
});  
  ref.listenSelf((previous, next){  
print('Log: $previous -> $next');  
});  
  ref.future.then((value){  
print('Future: $value');  
});  
return0;  
}  
// After  
@riverpod  
classValueextends _$Value{  
@override  
Futurebuild()async{  
    ref.listen(anotherProvider,(previous, next){  
      ref.state++;  
});  
listenSelf((previous, next){  
print('Log: $previous -> $next');  
});  
    future.then((value){  
print('Future: $value');  
});  
return0;  
}  
}  
```
Similarly, all Ref subclasses are removed (such as but not limited to `ProviderRef`, `FutureProviderRef`, etc).
This primarily affects code-generation. Instead of `MyProviderRef`, you can now use `Ref` directly:
```
@riverpod  
-int example(ExampleRef ref) {  
+int example(Ref ref) {  
 // ...  
}  
```
## AutoDispose interfaces are removed.​
The auto-dispose feature is simplified. Instead of relying on a clone of all interfaces, interfaces are unified. In short, instead of `AutoDisposeProvider`, `AutoDisposeNotifier`, etc, you now have `Provider`, `Notifier`, etc. The behavior is the same, but the API is simplified.
To easily migrate, you can do a case-sensitive replace of `AutoDispose` to 
## The family variant of Notifiers is removed​
In the same vein as the previous point, the family variant of Notifiers has been removed. Now, we only use `Notifier`/`AsyncNotifier`/`StreamNotifier`, and `FamilyNotifier`/... have been removed.
To migrate, you will need to replace:
  * `FamilyNotifier` -> `Notifier`
  * `FamilyAsyncNotifier` -> `AsyncNotifier`
  * `FamilyStreamNotifier` -> `StreamNotifier`
Then, you will need to:
  * Remove the parameter from the `build` method
  * Add a constructor on your Notifier
An example of this migration is as follows:
```
final provider = NotifierProvider.family(CounterNotifier.new);  
-class CounterNotifier extends FamilyNotifier {  
+class CounterNotifier extends Notifier {  
+  CounterNotifier(this.arg);  
+  final String arg;  
  @override  
-  int build(String arg) {  
+  int build() {  
    // Use `arg` as needed  
     return 0;  
  }  
}  
```
## Provider failures are now rethrown as ProviderExceptions​
In Riverpod 3.0, all provider failures are rethrown as `ProviderException`s. This means that if a provider fails to compute its value, reading it will throw a `ProviderException` instead of the original error.
This can impact you if you were relying on the original error type to handle specific errors. To migrate, you can catch the `ProviderException` and extract the original error from it:
```
try {  
 await ref.read(myProvider.future);  
-} on NotFoundException {  
-  // Handle NotFoundException  
+} on ProviderException catch (e) {  
+  if (e.exception is NotFoundException) {  
+    // Handle NotFoundException  
+  }  
}  
```
This is only necessary if you were explicitly relying on try/catch to handle such error.
If you are using [AsyncValue] to check for errors, you don't need to change anything:
```
AsyncValue value = ref.watch(myProvider);  
if(value.error isNotFoundException){  
// Handle NotFoundException  
// This still works today  
}  
```
