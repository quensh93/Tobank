# How to reduce provider/widget rebuilds
With everything we've seen so far, we can already build a fully functional application. However, you may have questions regarding performance.
In this page, we will cover a few tips and tricks to possibly optimize your code.
Before doing any optimization, make sure to benchmark your application. The added complexity of the optimizations may not be worth minor gains.
## Filtering widget/provider rebuild using "select".​
You may have noticed that, by default, using `ref.watch` causes consumers/providers to rebuild whenever _any_ of the properties of an object changes.  
For instance, watching a `User` and only using its "name" will still cause the consumer to rebuild if the "age" changes.
But in case you have a consumer using only a subset of the properties, you want to avoid rebuilding the widget when the other properties change.
This can be achieved by using the `select` functionality of providers.  
When doing so, `ref.watch` will no-longer return the full object, but rather the selected properties.  
And your consumers/providers will now rebuild only if those selected properties change.

```
classUser{  
  late String firstName, lastName;  
}  
final provider =Provider(  
(ref)=>User()  
..firstName ='John'  
..lastName ='Doe',  
);  
classConsumerExampleextendsConsumerWidget{  
@override  
Widgetbuild(BuildContext context,WidgetRef ref){  
// Instead of writing:  
// String name = ref.watch(provider).firstName!;  
// We can write:  
String name = ref.watch(provider.select((it)=> it.firstName));  
// This will cause the widget to only listen to changes on "firstName".  
returnText('Hello $name');  
}  
}  
```
```
classUser{  
  late String firstName, lastName;  
}  
@riverpod  
Userexample(Ref ref)=>User()  
..firstName ='John'  
..lastName ='Doe';  
classConsumerExampleextendsConsumerWidget{  
@override  
Widgetbuild(BuildContext context,WidgetRef ref){  
// Instead of writing:  
// String name = ref.watch(provider).firstName!;  
// We can write:  
String name = ref.watch(exampleProvider.select((it)=> it.firstName));  
// This will cause the widget to only listen to changes on "firstName".  
returnText('Hello $name');  
}  
}  
```
It is possible to call `select` as many times as you wish. You are free to call it once per property you desire.
The selected properties are expected to be immutable. Returning a `List` and then mutating that list will not trigger a rebuild.
Using `select` slightly slows down individual read operations and increase a tiny bit the complexity of your code.  
It may not be worth using it if those "other properties" rarely change.
### Selecting asynchronous properties​
In case you are trying to optimize a provider listening to another provider, chances are that other provider is asynchronous.
Normally, you would `ref.watch(anotherProvider.future)` to get the value.  
The issue is, `select` will apply on an `AsyncValue` – which is not something you can await.
For this purpose, you can instead use `selectAsync`. It is unique to asynchronous code, and enables performing a `select` operation on the data emitted by a provider.  
Its usage is similar to that of `select`, but returns a `Future` instead:
  * riverpod
  * riverpod_generator
```
final provider =FutureProvider((ref)async{  
// Wait for a user to be available, and listen to only the "firstName" property  
final firstName =await ref.watch(  
    userProvider.selectAsync((it)=> it.firstName),  
);  
// TODO use "firstName" to fetch something else  
});  
```
```
@riverpod  
Object?example(Ref ref)async{  
// Wait for a user to be available, and listen to only the "firstName" property  
final firstName =await ref.watch(  
    userProvider.selectAsync((it)=> it.firstName),  
);  
// TODO use "firstName" to fetch something else  
}  
```
