# Product Overview

## ToBank SDUI

A Flutter-based Server-Driven UI (SDUI) application built on the STAC framework. The project enables dynamic UI rendering from JSON configurations, allowing UI updates without app releases.

## Key Capabilities

- **Server-Driven UI**: Renders UI components from JSON configurations using the STAC framework
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns (data, domain, presentation layers)
- **State Management**: Uses Riverpod for reactive state management
- **Debug Panel**: Built-in debug panel for development and testing
- **Network Layer**: Retrofit + Dio for API communication with error handling
- **Secure Storage**: Flutter Secure Storage for sensitive data
- **Functional Programming**: fpdart for functional error handling (Either, TaskEither)

## Architecture Philosophy

The project combines:
- **STAC Framework**: For server-driven UI capabilities
- **Clean Architecture**: For maintainable, testable code structure
- **Feature-First Organization**: Self-contained feature modules
- **Riverpod**: For dependency injection and state management

## Development Focus

This is a demo/template project showcasing SDUI patterns with production-ready architecture. The codebase includes reference implementations and examples for building scalable Flutter applications with dynamic UI capabilities.
